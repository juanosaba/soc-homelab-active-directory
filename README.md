# SOC Home Lab – Active Directory

This project documents the creation of a hands-on Active Directory lab designed to simulate real-world enterprise environments from a defensive (SOC) perspective.

The objective is to understand authentication flows, privilege escalation risks, attack paths and detection strategies inside a Windows domain environment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Install and configure a Domain Controller
- Deploy Active Directory (AD)
- Join a Windows client to the domain
- Generate authentication events
- Analyze security logs
- Simulate suspicious activity for detection practice

---

## 🏗️ Lab Architecture (Phase 1)

- Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)
- Windows 10/11 Client (Domain-joined machine)
- VMware Workstation (Virtualization)
- Windows 11 Host Machine

Network: Isolated Host-Only Network

---

## 🔐 Focus Areas

- Kerberos authentication
- Log analysis
- Privilege escalation scenarios
- Defensive detection mindset
- Active Directory security fundamentals

---

This repository will evolve as new attack simulations and detection techniques are implemented.
